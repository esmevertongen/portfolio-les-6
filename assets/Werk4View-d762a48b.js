The reason for the naming was that, for this assignment, we were tasked with alienating everyday habits and commonly accepted practices. There's a book by Horace Mitchell Miner titled 'Body Ritual among the Nacirema,' in which he does just that. For my project, I focused on plastic surgery, more specifically, cosmetic plastic surgery. I chose this topic because I find it intriguing, yet also challenging to talk and think about it, as it involves people opting for procedures solely intended to enhance their appearance. In the slides displayed below, you'll see various pages from the book, which I've heavily edited, focusing on women (as they undergo more cosmetic surgery than men, making them more relevant to the topic).
