We were required to design an album cover for an already existing / broken up band, and I selected Talking Heads from the list of options. The challenge was to create a design for the album you selected that would be suitable for the year 2023 (as many of the bands evidently already have an album cover). For this project, I chose to emulate the appearance of a cereal box on the front cover, with the back cover featuring an ingredients list. The name of the album I chose is ‘Songs about Building and Food’ and therefore I wanted to create the atmosphere of a supermarket. It&#39;s worth noting that I have mixed feelings about the album cover since we were obligated to create what our teachers deemed appropriate. However, I am not dissapointed with the final result, I just think that there were many other paths I could have taken. </div></div><div class="pt-10 w-100 h-100 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4"><img src="'+a+'" alt="Picture 1"><img src="'+o+'" alt="Picture 2"></div>',2);function n(i,h){return r}const c=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{c as default};
